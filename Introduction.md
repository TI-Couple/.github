# Introduction

Hello there stranger. The person that made this text is @kikinho11. 

Me and the other member in this organization are doing codes for the both of us since we are both Developers.
We wanted a way to store our repositories without having to always give specific permission to each other.

# About this organization

Like i said in the introduction, this is just a organization to store codes that we want to share with each other. Theres a possibility that we can create some public repositories but most of them will be private.

Also another warning, we are both portuguese speakers so most of the code will be in Portuguese. If we do create some public repositories, i will translate most of them.

(Portuguese version of this file may be released in the future)
